# ConvoCheck
The Code convertor and checker

This a project which is going to bulid up in java.
We are going to design a code convertor which will convert the following codes into what the user wants to.
1) Binary Code/Number
2) Decimal Code/Number
3) Octal Code/Number
4) Hexadecimal Code/Number
5) Gray Code
6) Binary Coded Decimals(BCD)
7) Excess-3 Code

There are also some Conversions and evaluations based on expressions as follows:
1) Infix Expression
2) Postfix Expression
3) Prefix Expression

For this conversion and evaluations of the above expressions I have created an Infix_postfix_prefix_operations.java file.
This file contains all the methods for conversion and evaluation of the above expressions.




Added infix to prefix convertor
prefix to infix convertor
prefix evaluation
strReverse method in PrefixPostfixEvaltion Class
Test class deleted
